    <p> The opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&M), often considered the dawn of modern transport, 
        took place on 15 September 1830. Eight trains set out from Liverpool to Manchester 
        carrying dignitaries including the Duke of Wellington, then prime minister.
         At Parkside the trains stopped to take on water, and former cabinet minister William Huskisson alighted and was
          struck by a locomotive, suffering fatal injuries. As a large crowd waiting to meet the trains in Manchester was becoming
           unruly, Wellington decided that the event should continue. On arrival in Manchester a hostile crowd pelted Wellington with vegetables

            and he ordered the trains return to Liverpool. Faults meant only three of the locomotives were still functional; the party eventuall
            y returned six and a half hours late. The accidents led to significant coverage of the opening, raising the profile of the new 
            technology, and within a month schemes were announced to connect the industrial centres of England.</p>

                NE woman has died—a woman attractive and rich, and young and witty; yet a veiled and silent woman, distinguished by no other genius but the divine genius—working hard to train herself, in order to train others to walk in the footsteps of Him who went about doing good. To follow Him, she spent herself in activity; she overworked because others underwork. Shall we let her have died in vain?

She died, as she had lived, at her post, in one of the largest work-house infirmaries in this kingdom—the first in which trained nursing has been introduced. She is the pioneer of work-house nursing. I do not give her name; were she alive, she would beg me not. Of all human beings I have ever known, she was (I was about to say) the most free from desire of the praise of men. But I cannot say most free; for she was perfectly free. She was absolutely without human vanity; she preferred being unknown to all but God; she did not let her right hand know what her left hand did.
